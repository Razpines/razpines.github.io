I'm Raz Pines—an Applied Scientist working on ML personalization and recommender systems.
I enjoy problems where you have to be both rigorous and pragmatic: define the objective, build the data and evaluation, ship a model, and make it reliable in production.

Recently I've worked on:

- Ranking and prediction with large-scale behavioral logs
- Time-series modeling and decision-making under uncertainty
- Building research-to-production pipelines with clear monitoring and failure modes

Background:

- 10+ years across applied ML and quantitative research
- Python/C++ plus modern ML tooling (PyTorch, LightGBM, Spark/AWS)
- MSc in Electrical Engineering and an MBA
