I’m Raz. I like building practical automation and tooling—especially when the “last mile” is the hard part.

If you want this to feel more like a classic portfolio page, add:

- A one-paragraph bio and what roles you’re looking for
- Your core stack (languages, infra, ML, etc.)
- A short “what I’m proud of” list with links to projects
